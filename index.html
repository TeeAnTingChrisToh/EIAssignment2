                    <h1>Bachelor of Accountancy</h1>
					<h3>Overview</h3>
					An accountancy degree opens doors to a wide range of career opportunities in professional accountancy services, commerce, finance, as well as many areas outside accounting.
					<br><br>
					Accountancy and its related fields such as taxation, consulting, risk management and corporate governance, is the cornerstone of an economic system. Whilst most accountancy graduates work in the financial reporting area, the knowledge, skill set and experience you obtain as an accountancy graduate equip you to venture into many areas and rise up the corporate ladder. Accounting and financial information plays a key role in the allocation of resources, on individual, corporate, and national levels.
					<br><br>
					As such, accountancy graduates are in hot demand in many sectors regardless of market conditions. All private, public and non-profit entities are subjected to financial rules, regulations and oversight. This is to ensure that management accountabilities are reflected in the financial information presented to their respective stakeholders and constituents.
					<br><br>
					Accounting skills are highly applicable in all sectors of the economy. Employers today recognise the value of accounting knowledge in their talent search and armed with a SMU Bachelor of Accountancy (BAcc), our graduates have pursued careers in a variety of industries – including asset management; investment banking; information technology; regulatory and trading.

					<h1>Bachelor of Business</h1>
					<h3>Overview</h3>
					The Bachelor of Business Management (BBM) programme aims at developing well-rounded students who are schooled in a diverse range of subject areas. Students will master the fundamentals of business management and leadership, and in the process, gain insights into the major areas of global business. Students choose a business major from a choice of seven business specialisations (corporate communication, finance, strategic management, marketing, operations management, organisational behaviour & human resources and quantitative finance). Concentrations within the finance major (wealth management concentration, international trading concentration, investment banking concentration, financial risk analysis concentration) and management major (entrepreneurship concentration) enhance students’ competitive edge in the job market. A distinctive feature of the BBM is the prestigious and highly competitive Lee Kong Chian Scholars Programme which allows scholars to enrol in a double degree programme, with Business Management as one of the two degrees.

					<h1>Bachelor of Law</h1>
					<h3>Overview</h3>
					In a major review of the domestic supply of lawyers, the Singapore Government concluded that there was a shortage of lawyers in Singapore. Hence, the establishment of the SMU Law School in 2007 marked a major milestone in the development of legal education in Singapore. SMU is honoured to be entrusted with this important responsibility.
					<br><br>
					SMU's undergraduate law programme aims to mould students into excellent holistic lawyers who will contribute significantly to society. The objective is to produce law graduates who have contextualised knowledge and the ability to think across disciplines and geographical borders.
					<br><br>
					Consistent with SMU's mission, the Law School adopts a pedagogy that is fresh and different. The programme bears SMU's distinctiveness of holistic learning, interactive pedagogy and international and practical exposure.
					<br><br>
					The ethic of the Law School is encapsulated in its three core values: Integrity, Scholarship and Humanity.

                    <h1>Bachelor of Social Science</h1>
					<h3>Overview</h3>
					In today's increasingly complex world, the study of social sciences has never been more important. The increasing connectedness of countries and markets, brought about by globalization in trade, cross-border capital flows and the advent of new information and communication technologies, has drastically changed the dynamics of interaction among individuals, communities and governments. To fully comprehend these developments and their implications for the future development of our societies, it is imperative to adopt a multi-disciplinary approach, embracing both quantitative methods and qualitative analysis.
					<br><br>
					The world needs a new generation of social science graduates right now: men and women who appreciate and understand the complexity of contemporary societies, and are well-equipped to become thought leaders of the future.
